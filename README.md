# SIC_SORTING
SIC second live session code

Note that both selection and bubble sort do note have parameters ( do not pass arrays) so the sorted array should be global with the same name inside the function.
small modifications should be made so that the function can pass an array, you should be able to do it by yourself.
goodluck!
